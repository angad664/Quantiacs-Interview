# Quantiacs-Interview
Write a Python function that accepts as input a list of lists
and returns a new list of lists where each list in the output is a
combination of elements from the input lists. 
For example, if you were passed:

[['a', 'b'], ['c'], ['d', 'e', 'f']]

The resulting list would be:

[['a', 'c', 'd'], ['a', 'c', 'e'], ['a', 'c', 'f'], ['b', 'c', 'd'],
['b', 'c', 'e'], ['b', 'c', 'f']]

Do not make any assumptions about the number of lists, the number of
element per list, or the uniqueness or data type of the list's contents.
